The idea behind the project was to set up a continuously deploying app that I could edit and update easily. The "posts/text-content" are written as HTML files, which are read as strings and then injected into the app. Thus creating new sections and posts require very little refactoring. The benefit with using html files as input, is  that they allow for great flexibility of the content. I can make each post distinct, with images, styling and sub headers, without the need to create a lot of custom angular components.
