<h3>Riksdagskollen </h3>

        One project I would like to highlight is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.oandell.riksdagen&hl=sv&gl=US"><strong>Riksdagskollen!</strong></a>
        (Unfortunately only available in Swedish). 
        It is a project I started in university to learn more about Android and mobile development.
         Over the years it grew into quite a successful app (Currently 4.6 on Playstore), 
         which I and together with a friend continue to maintain and develop.
         <br><br>
        The app provides an accessible way to follow the elected representatives and view the work that goes on in the Swedish parliament. 
        Riksdagskollen parses the public API from the Swedish parliament and offers features such as viewing, reading and listening to debates, viewing decisions and voting history, customized push notifications and more. 
        Riksdagskollen also integrates the Twitter API to show elected officials and parties tweet timelines. Currently we are working on implementing our own backendservice to provide more data such as polling numbers.
