<h3>Riksdagskollen </h3>

        One project I would like to highlight is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.oandell.riksdagen&hl=sv&gl=US"><strong>Riksdagskollen!</strong></a>
        (Unfortunately only available in Swedish). 
        It is a project I started in university to learn more about Android and mobile development.
         Over the years it grew into quite a successful app (Currently 4.6 on Playstore), 
         which I and together with a friend continue to maintain and develop
