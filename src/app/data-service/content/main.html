<p>I am a professional software developer & engineer currently delivering frontend solutions 
    for Vizlib in Stockholm, Sweden.  Even though my professional focus at the moment 
    is React and Angular, I have a passion for the entire tech stack,
     from the UI to the database. Check out some of my projects!
</p>
<p>
One project I would like to highlight is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.oandell.riksdagen&hl=sv&gl=US"><strong>Riksdagskollen!</strong></a>
(Unfortunately only available in Swedish). 
It is a project I started in university to learn more about Android and mobile development.
 Over the years it grew into quite a successful app (Currently 4.6 on Playstore), 
 which I and together with a friend continue to maintain and develop.

I feel like I have only just dipped my toes in the water when it comes to this industry, and I am already loving the international setting, the challenges, and the amazing people it offers.  I can't wait to see what technologies, opportunities, and interesting problems lies in the future!
