    A site to talk about myself and showcase some projects. It was also a way of practicing some web development and exploring tech I was
    felt unfammiliar with, such as webpack and continues deployment. The site went through a few itterations and is still under development.
    It could still use some polish, but perfection is usually the enemy of actually releasing something!
